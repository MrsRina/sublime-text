Neon Color Scheme v3.1.0
========================

Welcome to an entirely new version of the Neon Color Scheme for users of Sublime
Text v3.1 (Build 3170) and above! Lots of things have changed, most importantly
the format - we've migrated from the old XML-based .tmTheme format to the new
JSON-based .sublime-color-scheme format, which not only is much easier to work
with, but is also under active development, with new features being added for
the next public release of Sublime Text.

Aside from the format change, I've rearranged the entire thing to make working
with specific languages easier, labeled the sections with comments that are
readable in the minimap, and, of course, added and tweaked a ton of new scopes.
Here are the languages, plugins, and Sublime features for which we have specific
coloring rules:

* Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
* Babel
* BracketHighlighter
* C/C++
* Clojure
* CSS and friends (SCSS, SASS)
* Diff
* Dockerfile
* Find in Files
* Fortran
* Git Gutter
* Haskell
* HTML/XML
* Java
* Javascript/JSX
* JSON
* LaTeX
* Logcat
* Markup/Markdown
* Matlab
* PackageDev
* PHP
* Python/Python Improved
* R/R-Box
* RAML
* Regex
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Shell scripts
* SQL
* SublimeLinter
* Swift
* Table of Contents/Task Tag
* Typescript
* YACC/Bison
* YAML

See the README.md file for links to the plugins mentioned

Many other languages will also look nice with Neon. If you have a particular one
you'd like me to spruce up, let me know. The next version of Sublime Text is now
in active development, with alpha builds available for registered users of ST3.
One nice side effect of this is that many of the language syntaxes are being
improved, which gives me greater opportunities for making them look nicer!

The .sublime-color-scheme format change requires a change in your
preferences file, from

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.tmTheme"

to

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.sublime-color-scheme"

Enjoy the new version, and please send me feedback, good and bad!
