Neon Color Scheme v3.2.1
========================

It's been a little while and I've made some changes and tweaks, so I figured it's
time for a new release!

Changes since 3.2.0:

- Specific support for new languages:
  - AutoHotKey
  - C#
  - Lisp

- Added/modified existing scopes
  - generic scopes
  - CSS
  - Find in Files
  - HTML/XML
  - Markup
  - Python

Enjoy the new version, and please send me feedback, good and bad!
