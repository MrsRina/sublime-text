Neon Color Scheme
+++++++++++++++++

Thank you for installing my Neon Color Scheme! I hope you enjoy using it as much
as I enjoyed creating it. It looks best when used with a dark UI theme - I use
SodaReloaded Dark, but there are many other excellent ones available on Package
Control.

To activate, add this line to your user settings:

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.sublime-color-scheme",

Or, select `Preferences → Color Scheme…` and choose "Neon" from the list.

If you have any questions, concerns, bugs, improvement suggestions, or anything
else, feel free to open an issue on Github and I'll do my best to help you out.
You can also find me on the Twitters, monitoring the Sublime tags on Stack
Overflow, and hanging out on the Sublime Discord server.
