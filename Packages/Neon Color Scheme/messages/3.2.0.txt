Neon Color Scheme v3.2.0
========================

NEW FEATURE:
I added the following files to a new folder called "widget settings":

- Console Input Widget.sublime-settings
- Regex Replace Widget.sublime-settings
- Regex Widget.sublime-settings
- Widget.sublime-settings

These are part of the "Default" package, and set preferences for different
widgets in the program. Each file here has just one setting:

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.sublime-color-scheme"

so that the overall UI is more consistent. One major advantage is you now get
syntax highlighting for regex search and replace, making it easier to find things
like missing brackets.


Changes since 3.1.0:

- Internal file structure organization
- Added support for Mediawiker (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Mediawiker)
- Additions and tweaks to various PackageDev syntaxes
- Added support for TOML
- Added CSS variables for styling popups
- Several changes to the globals section to theming the UI itself
- Improved highlighting for function annotations in Python
- New YAML scopes
- Regex tweaks

Remember to change your settings from

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.tmTheme"

to

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.sublime-color-scheme"

Enjoy the new version, and please send me feedback, good and bad!
