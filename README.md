# sublime-text

my personal configs and mainly themes and stuff, I do not own anything here.

## Keybinds and Stuff

`ctrl` + `[` or `]`: move between multi-open files, `[` left, `]` right  
`ctrl` + `\`: opens default sublime-text console  
`ctrl` + `alt`: opens terminus on sublime-text console position  
`ctrl` + `alt` + `return`: opens terminus on a tab

Others are default keybinds

## LSP for C++, Python and Rust

I do not care about warnings and highlights, subl is not the best editor for do working LSP stuff,
so sometimes it just do not works, so I remove all warnings and stuff.

Python works okay.

C++ works okay.

Rust works okay.

## My Themes and Color Schemes

Goto select color schemes and type `wasted`, you will find all my color schemes. This is called wasted because of my life, wasted love in someone who does not loved me...

My unique theme is the adpative where there is small tweaks, icons, and hidden `FOLDERS`.
