# sublime-text

my personal configs and mainly themes and stuff, I do not own anything here.

## Keybinds and Stuff

`ctrl` + `[` or `]`: move between multi-opened files `[` left `]` right  
`ctrl` + `\`: opens default sublime-text console  
`ctrl` + `alt`: opens terminus on sublime-text console position  
`ctrl` + `alt` + `return`: opens terminus on a tab

Others are default keybinds

## LSP for C++, Python and Rust

I do not care about warnings and highlights, subl is not the best editor for do working LSP stuff,
so sometimes it just does not works, so I remove all warnings and stuff.

Python works okay.

C++ works okay.

Rust works okay.

## My Themes and Color Schemes

Go to select color schemes and type `wasted`, you will find all my color schemes. This is called wasted because of my life, wasted love in someone who lied to me and made my heart as a joy..

My unique theme is the adpative where there is a small tweak on icons and labels for example hidden `FOLDERS`.
